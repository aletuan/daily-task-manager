- Use FastAPI's dependency injection for database sessions.
- Use Pydantic models for request/response schemas.
- Follow RESTful API design for routes.
- Scaffold endpoints inside `app.py`.
- Include CORS middleware if needed (use `fastapi.middleware.cors`).
- Use `uvicorn` for local development and testing.
- Organize routers in `routers/` folder, keep models in `models/`.
- Use `async def` consistently for endpoint handlers.
